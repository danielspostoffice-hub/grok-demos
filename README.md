# Grok Demos

User's focus centers on data extraction and analysis. After six months and 19k+ dialogue exchanges, data is to be combed and sifted via Python-based tools.

Python projects built on Grok / xAI API.  
Beginner → advanced progression. Goal: land a role at xAI.

Self-taught grind (Software Engineer grad March 2026 + ML/DS/AI/API immediately following and extending into summer 2026).  
All interest in backend, i.e., what makes the machine REALLY work.

Root clean: numbered projects only, updated weekly UFN.

### Projects (increasing difficulty)

01-minimal-flask-api  
Baseline runnable server.

02-xai-api-client  
Single Grok API call (CLI).

03-xai-reasoning-loop  
Multi-turn self-critique chain.

04-grok-data-extractor  
Parse personal Grok export → local CSV (privacy-safe, skips billing).

05-grok-data-analysis  
Pandas stats on CSV (length, daily, role, top prompts, words).

06-grok-data-viz  
Matplotlib/wordcloud daily bar + prompt cloud.

07-grok-token-estimate  
Rough tokens + cost.

08-grok-prompt-clustering  
KMeans + TF-IDF on opening prompts.

09-grok-anomaly-detection  
IsolationForest outliers on prompt lengths.

10-grok-cluster-tokens  
Tokens per cluster.

11-grok-data-dashboard  
Plotly interactive daily + cluster scatter.

12-grok-cluster-tokens (duplicate fix later)

13-grok-prompt-umap  
UMAP + Plotly prompt embeddings.

14-grok-self-coach  
Chroma RAG on prompts (batched).

More to follow, much more.

### Tech
Python 3.13, openai client, pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud, scikit-learn, plotly, chromadb, sentence-transformers.

### Run any project
`cd` into folder → `pip install -r requirements.txt` → `python main_script.py`

All data local only—no leaks.

### Future
- Grok reflection on RAG results
- Token per cluster
- Advanced viz / dashboard
- Agentic self-coach
- Anything reasoning/data/tooling on Grok logs

Feedback welcome.
