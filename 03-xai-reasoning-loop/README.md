\# 03 - xAI Reasoning Loop



Multi-turn self-critique on classic Fermi estimation (piano tuners in NYC).



\## Why

Escalates 02: 5-turn chain where Grok critiques and improves its own prior answer. Real chain-of-thought refinement demo—core xAI reasoning territory.



\## Run

Copy .env from 02 here (same key).

python reasoning\_loop.py



Outputs full chain—watch estimate tighten over turns.



Costs ~5x single call.
