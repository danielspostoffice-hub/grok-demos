# Proposal: The Analogy Crown  
## An Alternative to IQ Testing
A Passive, Lifelong Test for the World's Sharpest Mind  
(Powered by Grok – Mission-Aligned for Truth-Seeking)

Intelligence isn't a timed exam or gameable IQ score.  
It's the ability to forge deep, original analogies that uncover hidden truths.

**The Concept**  
Every 4 years (or rolling leaderboard), volunteers opt-in:  
"Submit my full Grok chat history for scoring."  

AI flags analogies → Human panel rates top contenders.  
No tests, no pressure – just your natural insights over time.  
Quiet thinkers shine. Young phenoms build points. Lifetime sages dominate.  
Anonymity allowed → "Shadow User #42" could dethrone anyone.  

Public debates rules (like Olympic committees): What counts? Plagiarism? Weighting?  
Democratized, multilingual, continually improved.

Unbounded scores – beat the record, claim the Crown.

**Scoring Rubric** (Gentner-inspired, depth-heavy)

| Dimension      | Weight | Criterion                          |
|----------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| **Depth**      | 50%   | Structural/causal rigor (10 = uncovers hidden truth) |
| **Originality**| 20%   | Novelty (10 = groundbreaking first) |
| **Illumination**| 15%  | Aha! clarity/new insight (10 = paradigm-reframe) |
| **Precision**  | 10%   | Accuracy + honest limits (10 = flawless bounds) |
| **Impact**     | 5%    | Real-world utility (10 = transformative) |

**Lifetime Score**  
Final = Depth-Heavy Avg × (Density + Breadth + Peak Bonus)  
- Density: Analogies per volume  
- Breadth: Domain diversity  
- Peak: Multiplier for 9.5+ outliers  

Better than IQ: Rewards real cognition, prediction power, and paradigm shifts.  
xAI could host it ethically (consent-only).  

What do you think? Prototype worthy? 🚀
